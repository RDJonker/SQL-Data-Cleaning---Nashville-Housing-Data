# SQL Data Cleaning - Nashville Housing Data

In this project I performed data cleaning using SQL. Firstly I standardized the date column. Then I identified null values in the property address column and populated those row containing null values. Next I split the address column into 3 sub columns, namely Address, City and State. This was done for both Porperty address and Owner's address. I also standardized the "Sold as Vacant" column to only have Yes/No answers, instead of Yes/No/Y/N. I then removed all duplicates and lastly I deleted unused columns.
